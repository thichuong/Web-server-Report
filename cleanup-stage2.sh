This directory contains the original monolithic files that have been successfully 
extracted into Service Islands architecture.

## Files Moved

- **handlers_backup.rs** (841 lines) → `health_system` Service Island
- **data_service.rs** (662 lines) → `external_apis` Service Island
- **performance.rs** (297 lines) → `health_system/performance_collector.rs`
- **cache.rs** (464 lines) → `cache_system` Service Island
- **websocket_service.rs** → `websocket_service` Service Island

## Service Islands Mapping

| Legacy File | New Location | Service Island |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| handlers_backup.rs | src/features/health_system/handlers.rs | health_system |
| data_service.rs | src/features/external_apis/ | external_apis |
| performance.rs | src/features/health_system/performance_collector.rs | health_system |
| cache.rs | src/features/cache_system/ | cache_system |
| websocket_service.rs | src/features/websocket_service/ | websocket_service |

## Restoration

If you need to restore any of these files temporarily:
```bash
cp legacy/[filename] src/[filename]
```

## Verification

Before these files were moved, the following was verified:
- ✅ All Service Islands functional
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ All API endpoints working
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Performance maintained or improved

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

- Zero circular dependencies
- AI-friendly modular architecture  
- Independent scaling capabilities
- Team collaboration improvements
- Production monitoring capabilities
