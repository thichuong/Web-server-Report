# 🚀 Railway Deployment - Ready!

Your Rust web server is now ready for Railway deployment! Here's what has been set up:

## ✅ Files Created

### 1. `Dockerfile`
- Multi-stage build for optimal size
- Copies static files and templates
- Uses debian:bookworm-slim for runtime
- Properly configured for Railway's dynamic PORT

### 2. `railway.json`
- Railway-specific configuration
- Dockerfile build strategy
- Restart policy configuration

### 3. `.dockerignore`
- Optimizes build by excluding unnecessary files
- Reduces build time and image size

### 4. `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md`
- Complete deployment documentation
- Environment variables guide
- Troubleshooting tips

### 5. `deploy.sh`
- Interactive deployment guide script
- Verification checks
- Step-by-step instructions

## 🔄 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Railway CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway add postgresql
railway variables set AUTO_UPDATE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
railway variables set HOST=0.0.0.0
railway up
```

### Option 2: GitHub Integration
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository in Railway dashboard
3. Set environment variables
4. Auto-deploy on push

## 🌐 Environment Variables Required

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Auto-provided | PostgreSQL connection |
| `AUTO_UPDATE_SECRET_KEY` | Your secret | For auto-update feature |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Listen on all interfaces |
| `PORT` | Auto-provided | Railway sets this |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Create Railway Account**: Visit https://railway.app
2. **Run Deployment Script**: `./deploy.sh` for guided setup
3. **Set Environment Variables**: In Railway dashboard or CLI
4. **Deploy**: Your app will be available at `https://your-app.railway.app`

## 🔧 Your Application Features

- ✅ Rust web server with Axum framework
- ✅ PostgreSQL database integration
- ✅ Static file serving
- ✅ Template rendering with Tera
- ✅ Auto-update functionality
- ✅ Chart modules and report generation

The application will be accessible at the Railway-provided URL once deployed!
